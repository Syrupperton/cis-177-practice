// PRIMITIVE data

//we need a way to reuse or access data, so we create a REFERENCE
//'const' alerts JS to reserve some space in memory
//we provide a name for this space in memory
//we use the ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR '='
//this takes the VALUE on the right and assigns it to the NAMED REFERENCE
const myString = "string";
//const cannot have the value reassigned

//use 'let' ONLY if we plan to RE-ASSIGN the VALUE REFERENCED by the VARIABLE.
let myNum = 23;

//if we're not sure what to use, use CONST for now and see if you get an error later on.
// 'CTRL' + '/' comments out a line
