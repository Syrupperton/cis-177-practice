// PRIMITIVE data

//we need a way to reuse or access data, so we create a REFERENCE
//'const' alerts JS to reserve some space in memory
//we provide a name for this space in memory
//we use the ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR '='
//this takes the VALUE on the right and assigns it to the NAMED REFERENCE
const myString = "string";
//const cannot have the value reassigned

//use 'let' ONLY if we plan to RE-ASSIGN the VALUE REFERENCED by the VARIABLE.
let myNum = 23;

//if we're not sure what to use, use CONST for now and see if you get an error later on.
// 'CTRL' + '/' comments out a line

//adding to what we did in class for homework
const gameTime = "sixty minutes";
let throwingYards = 100;
let rushingYards = 100;
var WIN = true;

//the const is the game time which will always be sixty minutes in every football game
//the lets are different stats could be different values in each game
//obviously there is a lot that could be added to this but, this is a very basic start for football stats.
// the var variables are for a win or loss depending on if the win variable is true or false
